== Change history
[width="100%", options="header"]
|===
|Date |What/Why

|2022/11/16
|Initial draft

|2023/1/30
|Unified the swinging of expressions + 
Updated the PDF build environment

|2023/5/26
|Upgraded the version of FlatBuffers to use (1.11.0 -> 23.1.21) +
 Fixed "Under what condition" content + 
 Added Semantic Segmentation to supported AI models
|===

== Introduction

* This is functional specifications of the sample code for deserialization to be provided to users. + 
The supported environment is Python/TypeScript. + 
The supported AI models are Object Detection/Classification/Semantic Segmentation. + 
It is assumed that FlatBuffers are used to serialize and deserialize in this environment.

== Terms/Abbreviations
[width="100%", cols="50%,50%", options="header"]
|===
|Terms/Abbreviations |Meaning 

|FlatBuffers
|Google binary serialize format

|FBS file
|File which defines the data structure for FlatBuffers

|===

== Reference materials
* None

== Expected use case
* Uses can deserialize and use serialized inference results.
** Users can deserialize and get inference results from existing formats by running the sample.
** Using sample code and documentation, users can understand how to generate and execute code for deserialize against their own defined inference result format.

== Functional overview/Algorithm
=== Functional overview
* Deserializes serialized inference results.

=== Algorithm
* Deserializes data using code generated from the FBS file.

=== Under what condition
* If you want to generate code automatically, you must have an FBS file.
** The version of the FlatBuffers-compiler used when generating code automatically is 23.1.21.

=== API
* None

=== Others exclusive conditions/Specifications
* None

== User interface specifications
=== How to start 
* None

== API parameters in each block
* None

== Target performances/Impact on performances
* None

== Assumption/Restriction
* Users cannot determine whether the output of the input AI task matches the deserialization code. + 
（Example: When the output of object detection is entered into the classification deserialization code, no error occurs.）

== Remarks
* None

== Unconfirmed items
* None
